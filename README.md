# Annex_Internship_Report_Master-2_Bioinformatics

## Annex 1: Table of comparative lipidomic bioinformatics tools documented in literature
The "Tools_comparaison" tab in the Excel document displays the various categories necessary for choosing the right tools capable of addressing the biological queries within the study. Meanwhile, in the subsequent "Tools_information" tab, you can access succinct descriptions pertaining to the application of each suggested tool.

## Annex 2: Lipid Ontology LION/web
The image shows us the Lipid Ontology used by LION/web and proposed by Molennar et al. (2019).

## Annex 3: Data table before and after normalization by log2
Tables displaying the initial raw data set beside the table following the application of log2 normalization.

## Annex 4: List of significant lipids by Lipidr
This files shows the sifnificant lipids obtained by the differencial analysis in Lipidr, both the COS and MAP diets display significant positive and negative lipids while the HPO diet does not show any significant lipids.

## Annex 5: Contrast analysis by Lipir
File showing the results of the contrast analysis by Lipidr for the diet MAP-CTL and HPO-CTL.

## Annex 6: PCA Heatmap by lipids and PCA-Heatmap by LION-terms Ontology
The PCA-Heatmap enables us to effectively compare the four diets and visually identify the lipids and LION-terms that exhibit up-regulated or down-regulated. 

## Annex 7: Metadata ranking mode CTL_cow vs CTL_goat
This document contains metadata that has been retrieved directly from the LION/web. Interpreting this data can be quite complex and requires an understanding of web server operations.

## Script nutrilip_cleandata_cow:
File using R-Markdown within RStudio for the purpose of conducting an exploratory analysis by applying statistical methods to examine the integrity of our dataset, as well as to employ log2 normalization for data transformation techniques.
